        <h3>Technical Support Analyst at The Hub</h3>
        <h4>April 2021 - April 2022</h4>
        <p>
          I began working at The Hub as Technical Support Analyst part time
          while in my final year at university. My primary role was supporting
          our lead developer by producing functional requirements on behalf of
          clients, testing new software, and documenting existing code.
          Additionally, I was responsible for updating The Hubs website using
          WordPress.
